### Project Structure and POM Dependencies

Framework structure is as in the image specified above.

The main dependencies can be categorized as of now in the following 3 areas:

* **Page Objects (under directory 'Locators')**
As of now, 2 pages have been dedicated for holding the page objects as below:
  - **Page Locators** 
  [https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101/blob/main/cypress/integration/Locators/PageLocators.js]
  - **Event Card**
   [https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101/blob/main/cypress/integration/Locators/EventCard.js]

* **Much required Utilities (under directory 'Utilities')**
As of now, we have 1 page which holds the date and calendar utilities [https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101/blob/main/cypress/integration/Utilities/utilities.js]

* **System Under Test (SUT) related configurations**
As of now, only the URL for access has been specified in the file (https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101/blob/main/cypress.json) but Cypress allows to configure multiple entries to be configured in this JSON file.

**And the main spec file containing the scripts for the [expected specified specs for testing](https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101/blob/main/cypress/integration/Specs.txt) is here -> [events_spec.js](https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101/blob/main/cypress/integration/events_spec.js)**

## What's Cypress?

Cypress is a super slick front-end testing tool made for the modern web. It's fast, reliable, and easy to use. You can write end-to-end tests that run in a real browser. 

## Why Cypress for UI Testing?

Cypress is an excellent tool for UI testing because it is specifically designed for this purpose. It provides a powerful and intuitive API that makes it easy to write tests for even the most complex web applications. Additionally, Cypress comes with a variety of features that make it an excellent choice for UI testing, including:

- Automatic waiting: Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear on the page before interacting with them, which makes tests more reliable and less flaky (**UI Automation folks know what big mess are flaky tests**).
- Real-time reloading: Cypress provides real-time reloading, which means that you can see the results of your tests as you write them.
- Debugging tools: Cypress provides an intuitive debugging interface that allows you to easily debug your tests.
- Cross-browser testing: Cypress supports all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## Getting Started

To get started with Cypress, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Open Cypress: `npm run cypress:open`

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can see all of the tests in the `cypress/integration` folder. From here, you can run individual tests or the entire suite.
