## What's Cypress?

[Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#In-a-nutshell) is a super slick front-end testing tool made for the modern web. It's fast, reliable, and easy to use. You can write end-to-end tests that run in real browser(s) [Chrome, FireFox, Edge & Electron so far]. 

## Why Cypress for UI Testing?

Cypress is an excellent tool for UI testing because it is specifically designed for this purpose. It provides a powerful and intuitive API that makes it easy to write tests for even the most complex web applications. Additionally, Cypress comes with a variety of features that make it an excellent choice for UI testing, including:

- Automatic waiting: Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear on the page before interacting with them, which makes tests more reliable and less flaky (**UI Automation folks know what big mess are flaky tests**).
- Real-time reloading: Cypress provides real-time reloading, which means that you can see the results of your tests as you write them.
- Debugging tools: Cypress provides an intuitive debugging interface that allows you to easily debug your tests.
- Cross-browser testing: Cypress supports all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## Getting Started

To get started with Cypress, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sigmakappa/Cypress101.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Open Cypress: `npm cypress open`

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can see all of the tests in the `cypress/e2e` folder. From here, you can run individual tests or the entire suite. 
* Or if you are intersted in running the tests via the command line, there's a plethora of options available [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line).

## Executing the main script

Once the Cypress Window is open, click the 'Amazon*.cy.js' files in red as below:
